SimplyVanish lists
-------------------------------------------


PLANNED FEATURES AND QUESTIONS
------------------------------------


*** GRAVEYARD (PRESUMABLY)
? make config flags if to register the listeners at all ?


*** REAL PROBLEMS
- !(add) Configurable: fake a lower number of players on list-ping [WAITING FOR FEATURE REQUEST]
? add configurability and on demand event registrations (by config !)
- !(adjust) Better xp orb handling !
? check collisions: on -interact: prevent vehicle and arrow collisions (other entities, how arrows?) with vanished players ! 
Tamable problems ...
PigZombies till problematic !
!? unregister hooks somehow ? -> would need re-enabling the plugin currently, because of listeners.


*** PERFORMANCE AND CONSISTENCY
? use entity ids or similar for fastest checking ?
? check update for efficiency (uh uh)
? Faster exclusion checks (mix-in permission?) for setFlags
? test performance :)
? remove the checking if players are online ?


**** COMMANDS
?(add) '/simplyvanish clear' command to let all players be seen again.


*** COMPATIBILITY / HOOKS
- ?hide / show player: collect Map<String, Set<String>> or similar then call hooks then hide/show cumulative
- !(add) prevent-hooks 
- !(adjust) Check PalyerJoin twice: lowest = update state, highest = update messages
- !CONSIDER: Delayed message on join. 


*** LANGUAGE
? language update


*** PERMISSIONS


*** FLAGS
? flag set aliases ? -> + use some class to wrap flag sets ?
? (add) Flag sets: permissions for applying just those flag sets ? -> not yet
* consider: flag without +/- => use default state or extra prefix (complicates all though)?* consider: flag without +/- => use default state or extra prefix (complicates all though)?


*** FEATURES
? (add) Expiration time for vanishconfigs (checked at getVanishConfig) to allow temporary vanishing. ? RSP- integration: invisible arena ? 


*** APPEARANCE
?(add) colored flag output: red = - green = + // name gray if default value and configured to show
? DisplayPolice for flags: DEFAULT, POSITIVE, NEGATIVE (Show only changes to those stats, saving and loading always with difference to DEFAULT)  
? some help text  / more info
- !(add) Panic: Digest warning messages where possible (show one instead of two). <- remove panic :)



STACK
---------------------------------------------


*** STILL ON STACK
? refactor: only use updatevanishstate also from doVanish and doReappear!
!?bugfix: static handlerlist atlogin event vs. stateevent
? add configurable messages for vantell
- ?cmd flag / bypass : allow certain commands by bypass flag.
? chat: /tell /me configurable: treat as commands or as chat?
command/other bypass permissions (then flag dependent), toggle by configuration ?


*** DEFAULT FLAG STATES
!(add) Allow setting specific flags as "configuration defaults" (saving will be by standard defaults), setting of defaults in constructor then.
!(add) Care: loading flags from file: allow manual entry *clear (check if possible, important for default states)
? how to "restore" old state (new flags, default config flags -> not restore).


*** OPENINV INTEGRATION
(wait for API)


*** 0.5.0 MINIMUM RELEASE ---------------------------------------------------------------


***API
! make config options available to be able to interpret all flags correctly.
? if simple config is checked: remvoe some tentries if at default values ?


*** Permissions
! consider for all/most flags: Make configurable if to use at all, if to use permissions only, or enable / disable by default.
? shortcut permissions (mapped!).


*** Appearance
!(Add) join message :if godded.
? order of vanished and god (vanished always first ?)

*** Teleport tool
! low range teleport : into the middle of a door block or next to it (rotating principle ?).
! at least two longer distance permissions.
! pass through and teleport. 
? safe ground feature 


**** Inventories [Make a basic peek setup, including silent chest (permission), and blocked chest (permission)]
? maybe just use permissions for allow real peek ? => no, but make permissios fit for distinguishing
!flesh out permissions for when to peek and when not.
!(add) /vanpeek <player> + right click inventories + ? right click players (!) [switchable by configuration !]
?(add) move Inventory peeking here ! [at first : permission based + vanish related, respect interact and bypass flag]


*** Actions on vanish
? OpenInv: toggle silent and blocked chest automatically when vanishing ?
! (consider) close inventories when payers vanish !
? (add) Workaround: Let all (nearby) tamed cats and dogs sit when a player vanishes !

*** Projectiles
!(add) Option to remove projectiles on hit.


*** Uncategorized 
? add configuration for block updates when canceling interaction. or maybe a list of ids for the item in hand ?
!(add) vangods command.
? remove checkInvolved checks ? 
!(add) API for certain config settings !
!(add) god mode - config: classical god mode + flag oriented godmode?
*** ?add ignore worlds to do no updating on those worlds and update on world changes maybe! Or hook into PlayersInCubes !


!CHECK: implications of API: maybe add API to call hooks or make it consistent with updatevanishdstate (HookChangedVisibilityEvent ?)
!(add) Tickets from bukkitdev
!(add) config for hooks +
